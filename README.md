# micro:bit JS code

These are micro:bit javascript code I wrote to test a bit of micro:bit coding functions, and hope to use for my daughter's coding education in the near future.

https://makecode.microbit.org/ sites allow me to code visually and share it, but it doesn't have creating account or keep all the code that I am going to write, so I decided to store codes here instead as Javascript.

If you want to use it in micro:bit, just copy the Javascript and paste it on the editor's Javascript editor tab, and simply switch the editor mode to Blocks if you want to visually see it. (like you do in Scratch)
